<h2>NCBI repositories and completeness of FAIR criteria</h2>
<p>The analysis of published research data included a qualitative assessment of FAIR criteria completeness using automated assessment tools like <a href="https://www.f-uji.net">F-UJI</a>. The analysis demonstrated that <mark style="background-color: #c1207533;">the NCBI repositories do not meet the FAIR criteria. They achieve an overall score of 4.2%</mark> just by passing the test “Identifier is resolvable and follows a defined unique identifier syntax (IRI, URL)”. All other FAIR tests failed.</p>
<p>While field-specific repositories generally show a low completeness of FAIR criteria, there are examples that score better. (For example <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/">the Electron Microscopy Data Bank</a> or <a href="https://codeocean.com">CodeOcean</a>.)</p>

<p>The last chart shows the FAIR scores broken down by the four main FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and grouped by NCBI repositories, other field-specific repositories, and general-purpose repositories. It demonstrates that NCBI repositories only partly fulfill the Findable principle and completely fail on the other principles, whereas the general-purpose repositories on average also achieve high to medium scores on these principles.</p>
